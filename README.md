# JavaScript-GitHub-Finder

Live Version: https://determined-pike-232c94.netlify.app/

**Note I removed my GitHub API key from public view, but app still demonstrates basic functionality.

This project uses pure JavaScript to find users in GitHub and display data in a basic UI. 

Simple project coded in Vanilla JS and Bootstrap CDN.

Created a simple user interface and called on GitHub's user API to return information based on corresponding usernames typed into the input field.
